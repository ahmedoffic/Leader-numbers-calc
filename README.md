# Leader-numbers-calc
 This code calculates the leader numbers -- the leader numbers are the numbers that are divisiable by primary numbers by 2 into whole numbers in an equation
# Example
* 7 / 2
- subtract 1 from 7 to be 6
- 6 is divisable by 2 it will be 3
- divide them into 2 groups of 3
- so it will be 2G3
- adding the 1 we subtracted from 7
- then it will be L + 2G3
- then if we calculated it , it will give us 7 the given number so we didn't change
